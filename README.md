# University Program System Simulation

This project is designed to simulate a comprehensive university program management system. Developed using C++, it aims to facilitate the management of various university operations, including course registration, class scheduling, and student performance tracking.

## Features

- **Course Registration**: Students can register for courses, view available classes, and manage their enrollment status.
- **Class Scheduling**: The system generates class schedules based on course requirements, student availability, and classroom capacity.
- **Student Profiles**: Each student has a profile that includes personal information, enrolled courses, and academic performance.
- **Instructor Management**: The system allows for the management of instructor details, including courses taught and availability for office hours.
- **Grade Tracking**: Instructors can input grades for students, and the system can generate reports on academic performance for each course.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The system automatically detects scheduling conflicts for students and suggests alternatives.
- **Reporting Tools**: Administrators can generate various reports, such as course enrollment statistics, student performance summaries, and instructor workloads.
